To see the javascript of the modules scroll to the last javascript tag of the htmls.\n
Both the resolvers and the modules have a template folder.\n
btw most of the modules have been coded fast af so most of them have crappy code, also why i donÂ´t use regex?\ncuz its a nightmare to get it into the json.
